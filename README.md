# netlify-functions-landingpage
A serverless-less landing page project on Netlify, including a signup via functions.

## Background
I read the interesting article on the [Serverless blog](https://serverless.com/blog/how-to-create-landing-page-with-serverless-components/) about how to create a landing page with Serverless Components, Netlify, AWS and Mailchimp. 

I wanted to test Netlify for a while now, but thought that the above example could still be striped down to a Netlify-only deployment. The Mailchimp API is still triggered via the included Lambda function for the signup.

## Setup

1. Fork the [project](https://github.com/tobilg/netlify-functions-landingpage) to your GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket account
2. Sign up for Netlify (free account), using the OAuth integration to the repo provider you forked the project to.
3. Sign up for Mailchimp (free account), for being able to create the mailing list funtionality
